1. Business Context & Problem Statement

Digital content platforms face a persistent challenge: discoverability under content abundance. In anime catalogs exceeding 10,000 titles, users struggle to identify content aligned with their preferences without explicit guidance.

Traditional popularity-based ranking fails to capture semantic affinity, while collaborative filtering suffers from cold-start limitations and sparse interaction matrices.

This project addresses the problem by designing a content-driven, explainable recommendation system that operates independently of user interaction history, ensuring immediate usability for new users and newly added content.

2. Business Objectives

Deliver high-relevance anime recommendations using intrinsic content characteristics.

Enable cold-start recommendations without relying on user ratings or interaction logs.

Provide explainable recommendations through transparent similarity metrics and visual analytics.

Ensure scalability and deployment readiness for production environments.

Allow dynamic dataset ingestion, enabling the system to adapt to evolving catalogs.

3. Scope Definition
In Scope

Content-based recommendation using cosine similarity.

Multi-modal feature engineering (textual + numerical).

Interactive recommendation control (thresholds, weighting).

Visual interpretability of recommendation outcomes.

Production-ready Streamlit deployment.

Out of Scope

User-based collaborative filtering.

Real-time personalization via user sessions.

Reinforcement learning or feedback loops.

External API integration (e.g., MAL scraping).

4. Functional Requirements
ID	Requirement
FR-01	Accept CSV/XLSX datasets with flexible schemas
FR-02	Auto-handle missing values and type inconsistencies
FR-03	Generate similarity-based recommendations in real time
FR-04	Allow genre importance weighting via UI
FR-05	Support anime-to-anime comparison
FR-06	Provide KPI-level metrics (relevance, diversity)
FR-07	Support dark/light UI theming
5. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Sub-second recommendation latency for ≤15k items.

Explainability: All recommendations must be traceable to feature similarity.

Robustness: Graceful handling of incomplete or noisy datasets.

Extensibility: Architecture must allow future hybridization.

Deployment-readiness: Stateless, container-friendly design.

6. Success Metrics

High average cosine similarity for top-N results.

Stable diversity score avoiding over-specialization collapse.

Human-valid qualitative relevance in OTP tests.

Zero runtime failures across dataset variations.

7. Key Constraints & Risks

Genre taxonomies are inconsistent and coarse-grained.

Popularity features risk dominance without correction.

High-dimensional cosine similarity may produce score compression.

Visualization must mitigate interpretability loss due to similarity saturation.

8. Assumptions

Dataset genre labels are semantically meaningful.

Ratings represent aggregate community sentiment.

Popularity reflects exposure, not necessarily quality.

9. Approval & Sign-off

This BRD defines a production-level recommendation platform, not an academic prototype.
